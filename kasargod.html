            <p class="card-text">Madhur temple is located on the banks of River Madhuvahini at a distance of about eight kilometres from Kasaragod town. Though the name Madhur Ananteshwara Vinayaka temple suggests that the deity is Lord Ganapathy, the temple is actually dedicated to Anantheswara, a manifestation of Lord Shiva. The temple was built by the Mypadi rulers of Kumbla in the 10th century and was renovated later to its present form in the 15th century. The imposing temple attracts not only devotees but also connoisseurs of architecture who find its blend of Hindu and Jain architectural styles fascinating.  </p>
