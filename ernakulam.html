        <p class="text-center" id="pfont">Idukki is Kerala's second largest district and has been blessed with numerous natural wonders. The high valleys and hill ranges of this landlocked region are fed by three major rivers - Periyar, Thalayar and Thodupuzhayar and their tributaries. Its forest still hosts many tribes and over half of the terrain is still covered with forests. People love going to the gigantic arch dam for getting its mesmerising view. Blessed with a wide range of trekking trail, each of them offers a spectacular view of the valley below and ranges above of Idukki. The place is also renowned for its exotic flora and fauna and one can come across many rare species while visiting Idukki.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Puthuvype beach, located in the western suburb of Kochi City, is one of Keralaâ€™s less frequented beaches simply because not many people know about it. The serene sea, the green topography at the beach and the lone trees upright in the shore makes it an ideal destination. The Chinese fishing nets afford a pastoral charm to the scenery. Its proximity to the city of Kochi makes Puthuvype an easy picnic spot. It is located at a distance of 5 km from High Court Junction. Puthuvype is a part of Vypin Island.</p>

            <p class="card-text">St. George's Syro Malabar Forane Church, locally known as Edapally Church is a Catholic pilgrimage church in Edapally, Kochi, India. Asia's largest shrine to Saint George, about five million people visit it every year. The church is thought to have been founded in 593 AD. It is regarded as one of the oldest churches in Kerala, after the seven churches founded by Thomas the Apostle in the first century AD. The church was originally dedicated to the Marth Mariam (Virgin Mary). In 1080, a new church was built adjacent to the old church. A nine-day festival is celebrated annually as part of the Feast of Saint George (23 April). The church, also a destination for non-Christians, attracts offerings of gold, chicken, and eggs.</p>

            <p class="card-text">One of the oldest existing Dutch palaces outside Holland, the palace was built in 1744 by Dutch traders and later extended and gardens were landscaped around it. The building was then the Governor's palace for the commander of Dutch Malabar, and in 1909 was leased to the British. It served as the home of the British governors, being the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj. In 1947, when India attained independence, the palace became the property of the state and was converted into a heritage hotel resort. </p>
